A network of self-sustaining inflatable habitats dotted the dusty landscape, their dome-shaped structures glistening under the faint Martian sun. Aeroponic gardens flourished within these artificial environments, providing a steady supply of oxygen and nutrition. Advanced bioengineered organisms had been introduced to the Martian biosphere, creating a miniature ecosystem that sustained the colony. Residents adorned futuristic spacesuits when venturing outside, traversing the vast plains in pressurized rovers that glided effortlessly over the terrain. Scientific research continued unabated, with teams exploring the Martian moons and the planet's enigmatic geological features.

              "{'text': \"Secondary Structures . Secondary structure describes the local organization\\nof various segments of the polymer chain. The local organization can take\\nvarious spatial arrangements, also called conformation. The diverse confor-mations found in proteins are primarily determined by the sequence of the Rgroups of its amino constitutents. In the case of proteins, hydrogen bondingbetween certain amino acid groups leads to folding of the polymer backbonein two geometric arrangements: (i) as an ahelix with a rod-like spiral struc-\\nture and (ii) as a bsheet with a planar structure composed of alignments of\\ntwo or more strands, which are relatively short and fully extended segments.Secondary structure of an aform is represented in Figure 3.12.\\nTertiary Structures . Tertiary structures represent the overall conformation of\\na polypeptide chain and thus the three-dimensional arrangements of the entireamino acid polymer. An example is shown in Figure 3.13. The tertiary struc-tures are determined by hydrophilic (ionic) and hydrophobic interactions and,in some proteins, by disul ﬁde bonds. For monomeric proteins, which consist of\\na single polypeptide chain, the three-dimensional organization is determinedby the primary, secondary, and tertiary structures. The complex tertiary structure of proteins is determined through its amino acid composition andsequence. In some amino acids, such as cysteine, tertiary structures enhancestructural stability. The b-SH groups of cysteine are involved in inter- and\\nintrachain disul ﬁde linkages as represented in Figure 3.14. Also, U-shaped\\nfour-residue segments, called turns , are stabilized by hydrogen bonds between\\ntheir arms. They are located at the surfaces of proteins.70 BASICS OF BIOLOGY\\nFigure 3.11.

The quaternary structure describes the number and relative positions of individual polypeptide chains, also called subunits.\\nSimilarly, the primary, secondary, and tertiary structures associated with\\nDNA determine its three-dimensional helical structure deduced in 1953 byJames Watson and Francis Crick. The two polynucleotide strands, each pos-sessing a complementary helical structure, are bound together by hydrogenbonding, which involves a speci ﬁc base pairing between an A base on one\\nstrand and a T base on another (A\\n/H17039T base pairs) or a G base on one and a \\nC base on another (G/H17039C base pairs).

The processes involve bothphysical and chemical changes. Furthermore, the chemical changes can be permanent (such as protein synthesis, DNA replication) or cyclic (such as conversion of ATP into ADP and back). The chemical changes occurring arehighly complex, often catalyzed (accelerated) by enzymes (reaction-speci ﬁc\\nproteins) and coenzymes (small molecules such NADH). The various dynamicprocesses occurring in a cell are illustrated in Table 3.4. Some classes of cellular processes fall in more than one category. For example, most enzyme-catalyzed reactions are irreversible; however, a few are reversible.\\nOn the basis of their biological function, the cellular processes can also be\\ndivided as shown in Table 3.5. The cellular processes listed in Table 3.5 arefurther discussed here.\\nCell Replication. The complex cellular metabolic process is necessary not\\nonly for the cell to survive but, even more important, to replicate. The primary\\ndriving force in life is the ability to replicate for the continuing survival of the species. In eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells, replication produces identicalCELLULAR PROCESSES 73\\n−OPO\\nO−O PO\\nO−O PO\\nO−ONNN\\nNNH 2\\nphosphoanhydride\\nbonds\\nO\\nH H\\nOH OHH H\\nFigure 3.16.

Eukaryotic cells replicate through an orderly series of events\\nconstituting the cell cycle (Lodish et al., 2000). During this cycle, the chromo-somes are replicated and one copy segregates into each daughter cell. Strictregulation of the cell cycle is required for normal development of the organ-ism. This regulation is found in the nucleus of the cell coupled with the repli-cation of the nuclear material. Loss of this control ultimately leads to cancer.In eukaryotic cells, the process of formation of the daughter cells is mitosis.\\nMost animal cells are diploids, because they contain two copies of each\\nchromosome. Mitosis is the process in which a diploid parent cell duplicatesits DNA, condenses it into chromosomes, and then splits to form two new cells.Thus, a parent cell produces two genetically equivalent daughter cells, eachreceiving two copies of each chromosome. Mitosis is the most common typeof cell division.\\nMeiosis is another type of cell division process by which a cell duplicates\\nits DNA, condenses it into chromosomes, but then splits in successive steps toform four new cells, each containing only one copy of each chromosome —that\\nis, half the number of chromosomes of the parent cell. Therefore, only one step duplicates DNA; the second step does not produce DNA. Meiosis produces sex cells, also know as gametes . The four genetically nonequivalentTABLE 3.4.

A cell\\ncycle is composed of two major phases: (i) the M phase, where the division ofa parent cell into two daughter cells for a mitosis process takes place, and (ii)an interphase, which de ﬁnes processes occurring within the cell before its \\ndivision. The interphase itself is composed of three phases: the G1, S, and G2phase. The main processes of these phases and their average time durationsare also indicated in Figure 3.18. The actual time durations depend on the typeof cell. The average time of 20 hours for the cell cycle is only representativeof the time a dividing cell may take and should not be confused with the timean organ may take to double the cell population by division. The G1 phase,which is the ﬁrst gap (G for gap) phase, represents the period during which\\nproteins, lipids, and carbohydrates are synthesized to prepare a cell for DNAreplication in the subsequent S phase. The S phase, where S stands for syn-thesis, represents the period during which the DNA is replicated (new copiesof DNA are synthesized) in the nucleus, by enzyme (DNA polymerase)-CELLULAR PROCESSES 75\\nTABLE 3.5. Various Cellular Processes in Biological Systems\\n•Cell replication: Process to produce or replenish cells\\nMitosis : Process whereby the nucleus divides into two genetically equivalent\\ndaughter cells\\nMeiosis : Specialized process whereby the two successive rounds of nuclear and\\ncellular division with a single round of DNA replication yields four genetically\\nnonequivalent haploid cells (germ cells)\\n•Cell biosynthesis: Production of cellular macromolecules\\nTranscription : Replication of single strand of DNA to complementary RNA\\nTranslation : Ribosome-mediated production of proteins from messenger RNA\\n•Cell energy production: Conversion of energy forms\\nGlycolysis : Conversion of chemical energy of carbohydrates to ATP\\nATP synthesis : Process of producing ATP from ADP from either:\\nChemical bond energy : Mitochondria (respiration)\\nLight energy : Chloroplasts (photosynthesis)\\n•Cell signaling: Use of biomolecules initiated speci ﬁc processes in adjacent or\\ndistant cellsEndocrine : Hormonal signaling of distant cells\\nParacrine : Cell to adjacent cell signal\\nAutocrine : Same cell stimulation signal\\n•Cell Death: Control of multicellular development\\nApoptosis : Programmed cell death through a well-de ﬁned sequence of\\nmorphological changes\\nCell killing : Cell death caused by ancillary cells of the immune system\\n•Cell Transformation: Genetic conversion of a normal cell into a cell having \\ncancer-like properties (oncogenesis)catalyzed reaction. This process is the key step in cell replication where the\\ngenetic code is replicated. The G2 phase is the second gap phase that preparesconditions for cell division to occur in the M phase. In the M phase, divisionof a nucleus followed by the division of cytoplasm produces division of a cell.The step of the division of cytoplasm, and thus the physical separation of thenew daughter cells, is called cytokinesis .\\nThe process of duplication of DNA in the S phase of the cell cycle is\\ndescribed by a replication fork scheme, as illustrated in Figure 3.19. In thisprocess a portion of the double helix is unwound by an enzyme called helicase . Then another enzyme, DNA polymerase, binds to one strand of the\\nDNA and begins moving along it, reading in the 3 ¢to 5¢direction to assemble\\n(synthesis goes 5 ¢to 3¢) a “leading strand ”of nucleotide using this strand as\\nthe template. However, this process requires a free 3 ¢OH group, which does\\nnot exist on the chain when the two separate. To begin synthesis, an RNAprimer molecule synthesized on the site provides the free 3 ¢OH group to begin\\nthe DNA synthesis. A second type of DNA polymerase binds to the other template strand; however, it can only synthesize discontinuous segments ofpolynucleotides, which are called Okazaki fragments . These fragments are\\nstitched together by another enzyme, DNA ligase, into what is called the“lagging strand. ”When the replication process is complete, each strand of the\\noriginal DNA duplex remains intact since it served as the template for the syn-thesis of a complementary strand. For this reason, this mode of replication is76 BASICS OF BIOLOGY\\nM\\nG1G2\\nS4–5 hoursDivisi on of nucl eusand cytopl asm\\n6 hours1–2 hours\\nSynthesis of DNAFormation of chromosomes and production\\nof regulatory proteins for mytosis8 hoursSynthesis of proteins, lipids, carbohy\\ndratesand preparation for DNA sy\\nnthesis\\nFigure 3.18.

Every process in a living cell involves cellular macro-\\nmolecules, or proteins. Thus, an important function of the cell is the biosyn-\\nthesis of proteins utilizing the constituent amino acids. The process ofbiosynthesis of proteins involves two steps: transcription and translation. Inprotein synthesis, three kinds of RNA cooperatively perform to lead to proteinsynthesis (Lodish et al., 2000; Stryer, 1995). These are:\\n•Messenger RNA (abbreviated as mRNA), which carries the code (geneticinformation) copied on it in the form of a series of three-base code called“words ”or codons. Each word is associated with a speci ﬁc amino acid\\nconstituent of the protein.\\n•Transfer RNA (abbreviated as tRNA), which deciphers the code inmRNA and binds to a speci ﬁc amino acid, carrying it to the growing end\\nof the peptide chain.\\n•Ribosomal RNA (abbreviated as rRNA), which complexes with a set ofproteins and RNA called ribosomes . These complexes, moving along an\\nmRNA molecule, catalyze the assembling of amino acids into proteinchains in the process of translation.\\nTranscription is the process of copying the DNA template to produce\\nmRNA, thereby transcribing the gene code from the DNA onto a strand ofCELLULAR PROCESSES 77\\nDNA polymerase\\nDNA polymerase\\nDNA ligaseTemplate strands\\nReplication fork\\nLeading strandDaughter DNA duplex\\nLagging strandOkazaki\\nfragmentsParent DNA duplex5¢3¢\\n3¢\\n3¢5¢\\n5¢ 3¢\\n5¢\\nFigure 3.19.

The RNA polymerase moves along the whole length of a gene (a lengthof DNA), producing an unzipping action and making an accurate copy of thegene in the form of mRNA. The transcription process is highly regulated andcontrolled at several levels.\\nTranslation is the process by which the template encoded in the mRNA\\nstrand leads to the synthesis of proteins in a speci ﬁc sequence of amino acids,\\nthereby translating the code. The mRNA passes out of the nucleus into thecytoplasm, where it attaches to ribosomes. The ribosomes “knit”together the\\namino acids in a sequence dictated by mRNA. As dictated by the genetic code,speci ﬁc tRNAs carrying the appropriate amino acid transfer the new amino\\nacid to the growing polypeptide chain. The completed protein chain is thenthreaded into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, where it folds up intoits 3-D shape. Subsequently, the protein is transported to the region of the cellwhere it is needed. It is further processed as it passes through the Golgi appa-ratus. The process of translation is a high-volume activity, because several ribo-somes can be traveling along a single mRNA, producing the same protein.\\nCellular Energy Production. Metabolic and reproductive processes inte-\\ngrate the macromolecules and processes to produce energy for synthetic\\nevents and replication of cells (Voet et al., 2002; Stryer, 1995). Almost all syn-thetic reactions require input of energy into the reaction. There are two prin-cipal forms of energy in the cell: kinetic and potential. Kinetic energy in thecell is in the form of heat, and to do work it must ﬂow from areas of higher to\\nlower temperature. Differences in temperature often occur in different regionsof the cell. However, most cells cannot use these heat differentials as a sourceof energy. In warm-blooded animals, kinetic energy is chie ﬂy used for main-\\ntaining constant organismic temperature. However, biological systems havedeveloped an ef ﬁcient mechanism to harness kinetic energy in photons of\\nlight. Within speci ﬁc organelles of plant cells (and certain prokaryotic cells),\\nthe process of photosynthesis converts light energy into potential energy,which is stored in the form of chemical bonds (i.e., glucose and fats).\\nThere are several forms of potential energy that are biologically signi ﬁcant.\\nCentral to biology is the energy stored in chemical bonds. Indeed, all of thereactions described in this chapter involve the making or breaking of chemi-cal bonds. The best example of energy production from chemical bonds isglycolysis , where glucose is degraded so that its stored energy can be used to\\ndo synthetic work. The second important form of potential energy is referredto as energy in a concentration gradient . The concentration gradients between\\nthe interior and exterior of a cell or across a compartment in a cell can exceed500-fold (e.g., protons in a lyzosome). This gradient can be utilized to moveions and waste products across membranes. Finally, the potential energy storedas electric potential (separation of charge) is a source of energy for the cell.In almost all cells, this gradient is ~200,000 V/cm across the plasma membrane.78 BASICS OF BIOLOGYThe interconvertibility of energy provides the cell with mechanisms to store\\nand utilize energy for cellular processes when needed. Living cells extract\\nenergy from their environment (food) and convert it into stored energy.Because most biological systems are held at a constant temperature and pres-sure, it is possible to predict the direction of a chemical reaction by measur-ing the potential energy called Gibb ’s free energy, or G. The change in free\\nenergy is represented as DG=G\\nproducts -Greactants .\\nThe natural direction of a reaction (spontaneous process) is that for which\\nthere is a decrease in the free energy ( DGis negative). Two factors determine\\nthe DGin a system: the change in bond energy between the reactants and prod-\\nucts (enthalpy, or H) and the change in randomness of the system (entropy,\\nor S). Where T=temperature, DGis de ﬁned as DG=DH -TDS.\\nIn biological systems, most reactions lead to an increase in order and thus\\na decrease in entropy. An example of this is the formation of bilayers by lipidsor proteins from amino acids. Both bilayers and proteins have lower entropybecause they restrict the movement of the lipids and amino acids, respectively.Only a few osmotic processes decrease the entropy of the biological system.Cells must expend energy to overcome this osmotic pressure when ionic gra-dients are needed for cell metabolism. To this end, active transport systemsare used to “pump ”ions in or out of the cell in order to generate a gradient\\nstate. The energy used to perform this transport is chemical energy, usuallysupplied by adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The process involves two high-energy phosphoanhydride bonds linking the three phosphate groups. Theconversion of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to ATP requires energy ( DGis\\npositive), which is then de ﬁned as the phosphate chemical bond. It occurs in\\nthe mitochondria through coupled processes known as glycolysis, electrontransport, and oxidative phosphorylation. In this system, a powerful protongradient is generated across the mitochondrial membrane through the trans-fer of electrons via the electron transport or respiratory chain. The primarysource of energy is that which is stored in the glucose molecule. In glycolysis,glucose is sequentially broken down to yield ATP , NADH (a reduced form ofnicotinamide adenine dinucleotide), and pyruvate. The pyruvate produced inthis process is utilized by the mitochondria in the Krebs or Citric Acid cycleto generate more NADH and FADH (reduced ﬂavin adenine dinucleotide).\\nElectrons are moved down the chain via coenzymes and eventually are trans-ferred to O\\n2to produce water. The electron translocation down this chain is\\ncoupled to proton translocation across the mitochondrial membrane. On theinner membrane of the mitochondria (these organelles have two membranes;the electron transport chain is located on the outer membrane) is located theprotein machinery for the translocation of ADP and free phosphate and theATP synthase complex. This complex utilizes the proton gradient generatedby the electron transport chain to synthesize ATP .\\nAs previously described, production of ATP utilizes aerobic respiration\\nprocesses, which use oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor. This energy pro-duction system is universally used in mammalian systems to convert glucoseCELLULAR PROCESSES 79into energy. However, plants have evolved to utilize light to produce ATP ,\\nwhich then is used to produce glucose/sucrose needed for plant growth. Thisis accomplished through a specialized organelle, similar to the mitochondria,known as the chloroplast (see Section 6.4). In the chloroplast, light energy is\\ntrapped in the thylakoid membrane by the principal pigment (also called chro-mophore): chlorophyll a(Figure 3.20). These plant chloroplasts have two dis-\\ntinct photosystems. As in the mitochondria, a complex mechanism of electronmovement and proton gradient formation is created within the chloroplast toproduce NADPH and ATP from harvested light energy. Chlorophyll is a highlyconjugated system in which electrons are delocalized among three of the fourcentral rings and the atoms interconnecting them in the molecule. In chloro-phyll, an Mg\\n2+ion is the center of the porphyrin ring and an additional ﬁve-\\nmembered ring is present. Its structure is similar to that of heme found inmolecules such as hemoglobin and cytochromes where the central ion is Fe\\n3+.\\nMost intracellular and intercellular processes are energetically unfavorable;\\nthat is, they require energy and, thus, in terms of the free energy change, DG\\nis positive. Some examples are synthesis of proteins from amino acids, syn-thesis of nucleic acids from nucleotides, and the contraction of muscles. Energyis released by the hydrolysis (reaction with water) of ATP to produce ADPand a phosphate, which in turn provides the needed energy for other cellularfunctions. ATP thus “stores ”energy by converting ADP to ATP using\\nprocesses such as metabolism of glucose to CO\\n2 and H 2O.80 BASICS OF BIOLOGY\\n3Chlorophyll a\\nMg\\nNN\\nNN\\nO\\nOH3COH3CH3CCH2\\nCH3CH3\\nOO\\nCH3 CH3\\nCH3CH3  2+\\nFigure 3.20. Structure of chlorophyll a.Cell Signaling. Cell signaling refers to a two-step process. In the ﬁrst step, a\\nsignaling molecule (e.g., a ligand) is bound by a receptor at a target cell. In\\nthe second step, the receptor is activated. Membrane-bound receptors respondto a large variety of extracellular signals, which range from light and odor tohormones, growth factors, and cytokinesis. The receptors are proteins, whichcan undergo a chemical change or a conformational change to switch from adormant, inactive state to an active state. The receptors can transmit signalsfrom the surface of the cell to the interior and ﬁnally to the nucleus, resulting\\nin up- or down-regulation of speci ﬁc genes. In such a case, the signaling ligand\\nmolecule binds to the extracellular domain of the membrane —inserted re-\\nceptor and subsequently triggers, in a cooperative manner, a change in thedomain inside the cell.\\nSignaling introduced by a growth factor leads to a global response, such as\\ngrowth, proliferation, and differentiation of cells. The different types of cellstimulation produced by cell signaling due to growth factors and hormonesare:\\n•Autocrine : Refers to the resulting cell stimulation when the receptor\\nresides on the same cell where the ligand is expressed (produced).\\n•Paracrine : Describes cell stimulation when the growth factor diffuses\\nfrom the cell to neighboring cells in the same organ.\\n•Endocrine : Describes cell stimulation when a factor is transported\\nthrough the bloodstream from the place of synthesis of the signaling molecule to other tissues (distant cells) equipped with receptors thatrecognize the factor. This is the case with hormones.\\nCell Death. Cell death is a necessary biological response for the control of\\nmulticellular development. Cell death occurs by two principal mechanisms:apoptosis and cell killing by injurious agents, which are listed in Table 3.5.These processes are further discussed here.\\nApoptosis. This process is often called programmed cell death (PCD) because\\nthe destiny of a cell is to die by itself. It is also referred to as “suicide by a\\ncell.”A programmed cell death is very orderly and necessary to destroy cells\\nthat represent a threat to the organism, such as cells infected with a virus, cells\\nof the immune system, and cells with DNA damage. There are two mecha-nisms that cause apoptosis to occur. One is triggered by internal signals fromwithin the cell such as an internal damage to a protein in the outer membranesof the mitochondria. The other is triggered by external signals, also called death\\nactivators , which bind to receptors at the cell surface. During apoptosis, cells\\nundergo shrinkage, their mitochondria break down, releasing cytochrome C,then ﬁnally the chromatin in the nucleus degrades and eventually breaks into\\nsmall, membrane-wrapped fragments.CELLULAR PROCESSES 81Cell Killing. This process refers to cell death by injury. The term necrosis refers\\nto a cell ’s response to overwhelming injury and is often called “accidental cell\\ndeath. ”The injury may be caused by mechanical damage or by exposure to\\ntoxic chemicals. Death by injury may involve a set of changes such as swelling\\nof cells and their organelles like mitochondria, with subsequent leakage ofcellular contents, leading to in ﬂammation of surrounding tissues.\\nCell Transformation. This process involves the permanent, inheritable \\nalteration of a cell resulting from the uptake and incorporation of foreignDNA. Normal cells can undergo this “transformation ”as a result of exposure\\nto viral or other cancer-causing agents such as mutagens. The result is thetransformation of the normal cell into a cell having cancer-like properties(oncogenesis).\\nCellular Processes of Current Interest. Some of the cellular processes that\\nare receiving considerable interest today are:\\n•Genomics : Study of genetic code and its regulation.\\n•Proteomics : Study of protein function as determined by genetic code,\\ncellular mechanism of drug –cell interactions, membrane dynamics, and\\ntransport across membrane.\\n•Cloning : Insertion of foreign DNA into cells or duplication of an organ-\\nism through genetic manipulation.\\n3.8 PROTEIN CLASSIFICATION AND FUNCTIONProperties of Proteins. Each protein has a normal three-dimensional struc-\\nture (shape) called its native conformation (Stryer, 1995; Lodish et al., 2000).\\nIn its native (natural) form, a protein is also sometimes referred to as the wild\\ntype. Genetically varied proteins, prepared arti ﬁcially, are called mutant or\\nvariant proteins . The three-dimensional arrangement of a protein is required\\nto perform a biological role speci ﬁc to the protein. The destruction or change\\nof this native con ﬁguration is called denaturation , which leads to loss of the\\nprotein ’s ability to carry out its intended biological function. The process of\\ndenaturation, leading to a change of the native conformation, involves break-\\ning of the noncovalent bonds described earlier, whereby the secondary andtertiary structures are disrupted. The resulting conformations are like randomcoils that clump together (a process called coagulation ) and precipitate as an\\ninsoluble aggregate, and are thus unable to carry on the intended biologicalactivity. Denaturation can be caused by heat, alcohol, and other organicsolvents, acids, and bases (large changes in the pH), certain metal ions, andvarious oxidizing and reducing agents. Denaturation can also be produced bymechanical disruption. Denaturation, such as that produced by heat, is often82 BASICS OF BIOLOGYirreversible. However, in some cases, renaturation of the protein can occur,\\nresulting in the return to the original structure/con ﬁrmation and function.\\nOther important properties of a protein are derived from its large size. Pro-\\nteins, because of their large size, form colloids rather than solutions in water.Proteins are too large to pass through the openings of the cell membranes and, therefore, they contribute to maintaining the osmotic pressure (pressuredue to concentration difference) of body ﬂuid. Proteins can contain both\\nhydrophilic and hydrophobic domains (amphipatic). Charged proteins are inresponse to the total net charge of the ionizable polar groups at the speci ﬁc\\npH of the medium. Protein degradation occurs in a process called hydrolysis ,\\nwhich involves breaking of peptide bonds (chemically or enzymatically), byaddition of water molecules, to produce free amino acids.\\nTypes of Proteins . Proteins are very diverse in their structure and function\\nand thus can be classi ﬁed into various groups. Based on structure and shape,\\nproteins can be divided into the following classes:\\n•Fibrous proteins , which are the main components of supporting and con-\\nnective tissues such as skin, bone, and teeth. An example is a collagen,\\nwhich is the most abundant protein in the body; it is a triple helix formedby three extended chains arranged in parallel.\\n•Globular proteins , which consist of polypeptides tightly folded into the\\nshape of a ball. Most globular proteins are soluble in water. Examples are albumin and gamma globulins of the blood. Hemoglobin is anotherimportant protein belonging to this class. However, it is also an exampleof a protein group, often classi ﬁed separately as conjugated proteins ,\\nwhich carry a conjugated group for their function. In the case of hemo-globin, this conjugated group is a heterocyclic ring called heme , which\\nbinds and releases molecular oxygen. The quaternary structure of proteinis tightly folded and compact, with the heme group contained in the centerpocket.\\nOn the basis of their function, proteins can be classi ﬁed in the following\\ncategories:\\n•Enzymes , which act as catalysts for a speci ﬁc biological reaction.\\n•Structural proteins , such as collagen, which form major connective tissue\\nand bone.\\n•Contractile proteins , such as actin and myosin, which are found in muscles\\nand allow for stretching or contraction.\\n•Transport proteins , like hemoglobin, which carry small molecules like\\noxygen through the bloodstream. Other proteins transport lipids and iron.\\n•Hormones , which consist of proteins and peptide molecules. These are\\nsecreted from the endocrine glands to regulate chemical processes. Anexample is insulin, which controls the use of glucose.PROTEIN CLASSIFICATION AND FUNCTION 83•Storage proteins , which act as reservoirs for essential chemical substances.\\nAn example is ferritin, which stores iron for making hemoglobin.\\n•Protective proteins , which provide protection to various cells and tissues.\\nAntibodies are globular proteins that provide protection against a foreign\\nprotein called antigens. Others are ﬁbrinogen and thrombin, which are\\ninvolved in blood clotting. Interferons are small proteins that provideprotection against viral infection.\\nProtein Function . Proteins provide a wide variety of functions. Many func-\\ntions involve binding with speci ﬁc molecules called ligands or substrates that\\nproduce catalytic chemical reactions as well as enable them to work asswitches and machines. Some of these functions are described here.\\n•Enzymatic Catalysis . Chemical reactions occurring in a cell are catalyzed\\nby proteins called enzymes (Voet et al., 2002; Stryer, 1995). A speci ﬁc\\nenzyme (E) binds reversibly with a substrate, S, which may be a smallmolecule (e.g., glucose) or a polymer and catalyzes the conversion of thesubstrate to a product (such as the conversion of glucose to H\\n2O and\\nCO 2). The mechanism is represented as\\n(3.1)\\n•Immune Protection . Another important biological process describes the\\nimmunoresponse of a cell as the antibody –antigen binding. Plasma cells\\n(found in bone marrow, lymphatics, and blood) produce antibodies inresponse to invasion by infectious agents (such as bacteria or a virus). Theantigens are the agents inducing the formation of antibodies. A speci ﬁc\\nantibody binds to a speci ﬁc antigen. The antibodies are Y-shaped mole-\\ncules, and the speci ﬁc binding is like a lock-and-key combination.\\n•Transport Across Cell Membranes . Another function of protein is the\\ntransport of small molecules to a speci ﬁc organ by binding with them.\\nHere a speci ﬁc site (a chromophore) unit such as the heme group in the\\nprotein, hemoglobin, binds reversibly with O 2to carry it to various \\nsites. There is also a considerable traf ﬁc of ions and small molecules into\\nand out of a cell. Gases and small hydrophobic molecules can readilydiffuse across the phospholipid bilayer, but ions, sugars, and amino acidssometimes are transported by a group of integral membrane proteins.These involve channels, transport proteins, and ATP-powered ion pumps.Transmembrane proteins are also involved in signal transduction, allow-ing a cell to communicate with its “environment. ”This speci ﬁc set of\\nmembrane proteins recognizes speci ﬁc biologic signals and, by a complex\\nmechanism involving conformation change, sends a signal to the inside ofthe cell.E+S E S E+P∫ Æ84 BASICS OF BIOLOGY3.9 ORGANIZATION OF CELLS INTO TISSUES\\nA tissue is a multicellular bioassembly in which cells specialized to perform a\\nparticular task contact tightly and interact speci ﬁcally with each other. The\\nfunctions of many types of cells within tissues are coordinated, which collec-tively allows an organism to perform a very diverse set of functions such as itsability to move, metabolize, reproduce, and conduct other essential functions.The various constituents forming tissue are shown in Table 3.6.\\nFigure 3.21 presents a schematic view of molecules and components that\\nbind cells to cells and also bind cells to the extracellular matrix.\\nWhat follows is a brief description of the intercellular components.\\nCell-Adhesion Molecules (CAM) . These are cell-surface-bound proteins that\\nmediate adhesion between cells of the same type (homophilic adhesion) aswell as between cells of different types (heterophilic adhesion). Most CAMsare uniformly distributed within plasma membranes that contact other cells.The ﬁve principal classes of CAMs are: cadherins, immunoglobulins (Ig),\\nselectin, mucins, and integrins. Figure 3.22 shows the major families of CAMs.ORGANIZATION OF CELLS INTO TISSUES 85\\nTABLE 3.6.

(Reproduced with permission from\\nLodish, et al., 2000.)Extracellular Matrix (ECM) . Cells in tissues are generally in contact with a\\ncomplex network of secreted extracellular materials called the extracellular\\nmatrix . This matrix performs the function of holding cells and tissues together\\nand provides an organized lattice within which cells can migrate and interact\\nwith one another. The extracellular matrix consists of a variety of polysac-charides and proteins that are secreted locally and assemble into an organizedmeshwork. Connective tissues, which largely consist of the extracellularmatrix, form the architectural framework of an organism. An amazing diver-sity of tissue forms (skin, bone, spinal cord, etc.) is derived from a variation inthe relative amount of the different types of matrix macromolecules and themanner in which they organize in the extracellular matrix. Connective tissuesconsist of cells sparsely distributed in the extracellular matrix, which is rich inﬁbrous polymers such as collagen. The cells are attached to the components\\nof the extracellular matrix. In contrast, epithelial tissues consist of cells thatare tightly bound together into sheets called epithelia . In this case, most of the\\ntissue ’s volume is occupied by cells, and the extracellular matrix content is rel-\\natively small.\\nThe extracellular matrix consists of three major proteins: (i) highly viscous\\nproteoglycans providing cushions for cells, (ii) insoluble collagen ﬁbers, which\\nprovide strength and resilience, and (iii) multiadhesive matrix proteins, whichare soluble and bind to receptors on the cell surface. Collagen is the single mostabundant protein in all living species. Although there are at least 16 types ofcollagen, 80 –90% belong to three types classi ﬁed as Types I, II, or III, depend-\\ning on the type of tissue they are found in. These collagen molecules are packedtogether to form long, thin ﬁbrils. Basal lamina, as tough matrix, forms a sup-\\nporting layer underlying cell sheets and prevents cells from ripping apart.\\nCell Junctions . Cell junctions occur at many points of cell –cell and cell –matrix\\ncontact in all tissues. There are four major classes of junctions:\\n•Tight junctions , which connect epithelial cells that line the intestine and\\nprevent the passage of ﬂuids, through the cell layers\\n•Gap junctions , which are distributed along the lateral surfaces of adjacent\\ncells and allow the cells to exchange small molecules for metabolic cou-\\npling among adjacent cells\\n•Cell–cell junctions , which perform the primary function of holding cells\\ninto a tissue\\n•Cell–matrix junctions , which also perform the primary function of holding\\ncells into a tissue\\n3.10 TYPES OF TISSUES AND THEIR FUNCTIONS\\nThere are more than 200 distinguishable kinds of differentiated cells that orga-\\nnize to form a variety of tissues in the human body. This section describes someexamples of the different types of tissues.TYPES OF TISSUES AND THEIR FUNCTIONS 87Epithelial Tissues . Epithelial tissues form the surface of the skin and line all\\nthe cavities, tubes, and free surfaces of the body. They are made of closely\\npacked epithelial cells arranged in ﬂat sheets. They function as the boundaries\\nbetween cells and a cavity or space. They perform the function of protectingthe underlying tissues, as in the case of skin. In the case of intestines, the colum-nar epithelium secretes digestive enzymes and absorbs products from theintestine. The specialized junctions between the cells enable these sheets toform barriers to the movement of water, solutes, and cells from one compart-ment of the body to another.\\nMuscle Tissues . The three kinds of muscle tissues are\\n•Skeletal muscles, which are made of long ﬁbers that contract to provide\\nthe locomotion force\\n•Smooth muscle lines of the intestines, blood vessels, and so on.\\n•The cardiac muscle of the heart\\nConnective Tissues . The cells of connective tissues are embedded in the extra-\\ncellular materials. Examples of supporting connective tissues are cartilage and\\nbone. Examples of binding connective tissues are tendons and ligaments.Another type is ﬁbrous connective tissues, which are distributed throughout\\nthe body and serve as a packing and binding material for most of the organs.\\nNerve Tissues . These tissues are composed primarily of nerve cells\\n(neurons). They specialize in the conduction of nerve impulses.\\nTissues provide coordinated functions of the constituent cells. The functions\\nof the tissues, however, are not just those provided by the constituent cells, but\\nare also derived from intercellular communications and from the extracellu-lar matrix (ECM) components. ECM acts as a reservoir for many hormonesthat control cell growth and differentiation. In addition, cells can movethrough ECM during the early stages of differentiation. ECM also communi-cates with the extracellular pathways, directing a cell to carry out speci ﬁc func-\\ntions. Through gap junction, two adjacent cells are metabolically coupled,because small molecules can pass from one cell to another.\\n3.11 TUMORS AND CANCERS\\nUnderstanding the molecular basis of cancer growth is of great signi ﬁcance to\\nsociety. This understanding can perhaps lead to the prevention, early detec-\\ntion, and cure of cancer. Tumor is a general term used to describe aberrations\\nin normal cellular behavior. Tumors differ from their normal counterparts ingrowth control, morphology, cell-to-cell interactions, membrane properties,cytoskeletal structure, protein secretion, and gene expression. Tumors caneither be benign or malignant (neoplasms). Neoplasms multiply rapidly even88 BASICS OF BIOLOGYin the absence of any growth-promoting factors, which are required for pro-\\nliferation of normal cells. Furthermore, neoplastic cells are resistant to signalsthat program normal cell death (apoptosis). These cells also produce elevatedlevels of certain cell-surface receptors and produce speci ﬁc enzymes. One\\nprocess by which normal cells can transition to tumor cells is known as trans-\\nformation . In this process, any foreign genetic material that causes cancer and\\nhas been incorporated into the chromosome is activated by factors in a processthat is not yet clearly understood. These “oncogenes ”interfere with normal\\nregulatory processes, resulting in loss of replicative control in the cell.\\nTumors that remain localized are called benign . In the case of a benign\\ntumor, the tumor cells resemble and function like the normal cells. The benigntumors pose little threat to life and can be removed without affecting anynormal functions of a tissue. Tumors in which the cells exhibit rapidly growingfeatures and possess a high nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio are called malignant\\ntumors, neoplasms , or cancers . They often do not remain localized and they\\nmay invade the surrounding tissues. Neoplastic cells spread through the body ’s\\ncirculatory system and establish secondary areas of growth. This behavior iscalled metastasis . Metastatic cells also break their contacts with other cells,\\nthus creating a degeneration of the tissue function.\\nHIGHLIGHTS OF THE CHAPTER\\n•All living creatures are made up of cells.\\n•Biological systems are classi ﬁed as viruses (non-self-replicating), prokary-\\notes (no well-de ﬁned nucleus), and eukaryotes (well-organized cell and\\nnucleus).\\n•Living systems are aggregates of water, amino acids, carbohydrates, fatty\\nacids, ions, and other macromolecules called biopolymers (e.g., DNA,RNA, and proteins).\\n•Cells undergo differentiation to form different types of cells and as-semble to form tissues, which organize to form organs with different functions. Various organs integrate to form an organism.\\n•A plasma membrane consists of a structure lipid bilayer that forms asemipermeable boundary around the cell. The membrane controls thetransport of food, water, ions, and signals.\\n•The interior contents of a cell, enclosed by the membrane, consists ofvarious organelles (compartments) such as the cytoplasm, cytoskeleton,nucleus, mitochondria, endosplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi apparatus,lysosomes, and peroxisomes. Plant cells have an additional organelle,called the chloroplast .\\n•Cytoplasm consists of the entire contents of a cell (except the nucleus)enclosed by a membrane. Cytoplasm forms the center of activities suchas cell growth, metabolism, and replication.HIGHLIGHTS OF THE CHAPTER 89•The cytoskeleton structure consists of protein ﬁlaments and is respon-\\nsible for cell shape, the mechanical strength of a cell, muscular con-\\ntraction, and locomotion, and it facilitates intracellular transport oforganelles.\\n•The central control house of the cell is the nucleus, which contains DNAdistributed among the chromosomes. It communicates with the cytoplasmby means of nuclear pores.\\n•The mitochondria, the “engine ”of the cell, is responsible for the energy\\nproduction in the cell.\\n•The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) consists of ﬂattened sheets, sacs, and\\ntubes of membranes and are of two types: smooth and rough. Ribosomesare present in rough ER and are responsible for protein synthesis.Smooth ER is where the synthesis of lipids and sugars occurs.\\n•The Golgi apparatus is responsible for monitoring the movement of pro-teins in and out of cells.\\n•There are more than 200 different types of cells present in the humanbody. The common types are epithelial cells, which form the lining on the inner surfaces of the body; blood cells present in blood; nerve cells,which are responsible for communication within the body; sensory cells,which detect sound and light; germ cells, which are responsible for cell reproduction; and stem cells, which are cells waiting to be assignedfunctions.\\n•The basic building blocks of cells are nucleic acids (DNA and RNA),proteins, saccharides (sugars), and lipids. DNA consists of four bases:adenine, guanine, thymine, and cytosine. In RNA, the thymine is replacedby uracil. The sequence of these bases in the DNA represents the geneticmakeup of the organism.\\n•Proteins are formed by the polymerization of essentially only 20 differ-ent types of amino acids.\\n•The three-dimensional spatial distribution in biopolymers, which deter-mine their functions, are governed by the noncovalent interactions suchas hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds, van der Waals bonds, and hydrophobicbonds.\\n•Proteins are diverse in structures, such as ﬁbrous and globular. They are\\nresponsible for functions such as enzyme catalysis, immune protection,and transport across cell membranes.\\n•Important cellular processes are: (i) cell replication to produce DNA and,subsequently, new cells; (ii) cell biosynthesis by a process of transcriptionto produce RNA and a process of translation to synthesize protein; (iii)cell energy production in a usable form; (iv) cell signaling to initiateprocesses in adjacent and distant cells; (v) cell death by programmed celldeath and death due to injury; and (vi) cell transformation that producesa tumor.90 BASICS OF BIOLOGY\",\n",
